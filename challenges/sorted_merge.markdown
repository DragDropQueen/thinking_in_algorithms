## Challenge

Design and implement an algorithm for merging sets of pre-sorted numbers
into a single sorted set.

## Levels

* Beginner: Merge two sets
* Intermediate: Merge three sets
* Advanced: Merge *n* sets based on the data supplied

## Examples

Imagine we have three sets:

* a: `[1,4,9]`
* b: `[2,3,5]`
* c: `[6,7,8]`

Then the merge should produce `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`.

## Limitations

The challenge here is in sorting, so don't use any built-in sorting method.
